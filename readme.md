# Hello Three.js

Welcome to the "Hello Three.js" project! This is a simple demonstration of using the Three.js library to create 3D Text and graphics in the browser.

## Description

The "Hello Three.js" project showcases the basic usage of Three.js to render 3D objects and text in a web browser. It includes the following features:

- Rendering a 3D text object using a custom font and material.
- Creating multiple instances of a donut-shaped object and positioning them randomly in 3D space.
- Applying materials and textures to the objects.
- Animating the donut objects to rotate slowly over time.
